			Hello, my name is Kendal Cockrel and I'm a Junior at Brown University studying Computer Science and Ethnic Studies. Born and raised in Detroit, MI, I grew up with love for computers and technology and was quickly dubbed the tech savvy kid in the family. I was the one grandma would call at 8am to ask how to "make the screen bigger" on her laptop and had to explain to her what an underscore was. ("It's on the same button as the hyphen, Grandma.")

			<br><br>
			One of my most meaningful achievements is being selected to be an undergraduate teaching assistant this fall for the same introductory course I took - <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs015/index.html">Object Oriented Programming in Java.</a> Though many students become TAs, becoming a undergraduate teaching assistant is particularly special for me. 
			<br><br>
			When I'm not reading or coding, you can catch me watching Sci-Fi movies and reading comics.
