			Hello, my name is Kendal Cockrel and I'm a Junior at Brown University studying Computer Science and Ethnic Studies. Born and raised in Detroit, MI, I grew up with love for computers and technology and was always known as the tech savvy kid in the family.

			<br><br>
			Currently I am an undergraduate teaching assistant for <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs015/index.html">CS15: Intro to Object Oriented Programming in Java.</a> Though many students become TAs, becoming a undergraduate teaching assistant is particularly special for me. 
			<br><br>
			When I'm not reading or coding, you can catch me watching Sci-Fi movies and reading comics.
